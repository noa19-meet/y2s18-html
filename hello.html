	<h2>The definition of Drama</h2>
	<p>Drama is a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and performance. It is one of the literary genres, which is an imitation of some action. Drama is also a type of a play written for theater, television, radio, and film.
	In simple words, a drama is a composition in verse or prose presenting a story in pantomime or dialogue. It contains conflict of characters, particularly the ones who perform in front of audience on the stage. The person who writes drama for stage directions is known as a “dramatist” or “playwright.”.</p>

			<tr>
				<th>name of type</th>
				<th>explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Comedy</td>			
				<td>Comedies are lighter in tone than ordinary writers, and provide a happy conclusion. The objective of dramatists in comedies is to make their audience laugh.  Hence, they use quaint circumstances, unusual characters and witty remarks..</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Musical Drama </td>
				<td> In musical drama, the dramatists not only tell their story through acting and dialogue, nonetheless by dance as well as music. Generally the story may be comedic, though it may also involve serious subjects.</td> 			
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Farce</td>
				<td> a farce is a preposterous genre of drama, which often overacts or engages clowning humor.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Melodrama</td>
				<td>Melodrama is an extravagant drama, which is sensational and appeals straight to the senses of audience. Just like the charade, the characters are of single dimension and simple, or may be stereotyped.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Tragedy</td>
				<td>Tragic dramas use darker themes such as disaster, pain and death. Protagonists often have a tragic flaw—a characteristic that leads them to their downfall.</td>
